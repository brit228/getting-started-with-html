  <h1>Important Concepts</h1>
  <b>Basics of the Web</b>
  <p>The world wide web is made up of network of communicating computers and servers which share data through the use of <em>HTTP (Hyper text Transfer Protocol)</em>, a protocol used by the web to request information that is stored on a <em>server</em> through
    an <em>HTTP Request</em> from a <em>browser</em> on a personal computer. The browser then recieves information from the server, and interprets the information to display to the user
  </p>
  <b>HTML</b>
  <p><em>HTML</em>, also known as <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>, is the language used by the web to describe to browsers what users should see, in the form of <em>text content</em>, and what it should look like, which is
    <em>markup</em>. HTML can also reference other documents, such as videos and music, and it can also provide links to other pages, in the form of <em>hyperlinks</em>.
  </p>
  <b>Tags and Elements</b>
  <p>An HTML document is made up of <em>elements</em>, which modify text content, provide links to other HTML documents, or reference other documents. These elements are comprised of <em>tags</em>, which tell the browser what type of element is being used.
    Some examples of tags include emphasis (em), bold (b), anchor (a), image (img), break (br), and paragraph (p).
  </p>
  <p>These tags may also contain attributes, which adds a value to the tag. For example, the anchor tag uses the href attribute, where the value references a url which links the content of the element to another page.
  </p>
  <p>As the computer interprets the instructions from the HTML document literally, it can be thought of as stupid. This is because a small mistake in the language created by the programmer could cause huge problems, as the computer might not be able to interpret
    it as it can only follow strict instructions.
  </p>
  <b>Inline vs. Block Elements</b>
  <p>HTML elements are either <em>block</em> or <em>inline</em>. Block elements form a box around the content, which separates it from the rest of the text, while inline elements are in the general body of text, and do not have the box surrounding them.
